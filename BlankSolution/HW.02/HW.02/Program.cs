            //5. Clear memory from the textReader object.
            //6. Initialize for loop which starts from 0, ends by arrayOfTextResult.Length - 1. Loop step = 1. Then do following steps on each iteration:
                //6.1. Convert each item of arrayOfTextResult to an 8-bit integer, write this value to "binary" variable.
                //6.2. Assign to i-th element of imageBytes array "binary" value.
            //7. Create a new file image.png (file path: D:\Photo\image.png), write the specified byte array to the file, and then close the file
